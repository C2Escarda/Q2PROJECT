They later promised one another to make enough money to achieve their dreams.</td>
        <td>After talking with a few
representatives,
they rebranded “Skibs” to “Pastee.” This officially started the beginning of the powerhouse, Pastee.</td>

of the founders, they decided to surprise him by making Pastee branch in other Southeast Asian countries.
Pastee products were being sold everywhere in a few countries, giving a name to the six people that managed to hit the jackpot.</td>
        <td>On February 29, the founders decided they wanted to do something big! So, we are branching out to different companies so that we can possibly branch out outside Asia. That is why we are here.</td>
